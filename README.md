(This is on the branch for the first refactor) 

# ChickenGameLibrary
A game library made for the CASIO fx-9860 GII calculator.
Might work on other CASIO calculators as well, like the Prizm.

Because of this, I have to use the Hitachi compiler and C89, what might limit this project in some places.

Maybe I will later make a version that also gets supported by OpenGL.

## Notes

- I'm not that good of a C programmer
- The license (MIT) is currently NOT repeated at the start of each file
