# This project is not supported anymore
I (MisterCavespider) abandoned this repository and started [another one](https://github.com/MisterCavespider/Zoldo), because this project had no future. There is no use for an OpenGL-like environment on a piece of hardware no one uses, and I don't want to do all that effort for absolutely nothing. The newer iteration is more oriented around making a game, less so around being the backbone of a game.

# ChickenGameLibrary
A game library made for the CASIO fx-9860 GII calculator.
Might work on other CASIO calculators as well, like the Prizm.

Because of this, I have to use the Hitachi compiler and C89, what might limit this project in some places.

## 'Final Features'
The engine should in the end have the following features:
- Graphics
  - Polygons (like in OpenGL)
  - RAM-friendly sprites
  - Variable layers for rendering
- Hardware:
  - Tools to aid Revolution
- Game
  - Gameloop + framecap
  - Easier input handling
  - Gamestates & events
  - Read savefiles
  - Vectors

## Notes

- I'm not that good of a C programmer
- The license (MIT) is currently NOT repeated at the start of each file
